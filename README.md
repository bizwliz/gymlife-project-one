- <div>What was your motivation?</div>
    We wanted to create a holistic platform that addressed the unique challenges people face in their fitness and nutrition journeys. We believed that a one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work, and everyone deserves a tailored experience that considers their individual needs and health restrictions.
- <div>Why did you build this project?</div>
    The creators of "GYMPAL" were inspired by the desire to empower individuals on their journey to self-improvement and well-being.  
- <div>What problem does it solve?</div>
    The primary problem "GYMPAL" solves is the lack of personalized guidance and support in the fitness and nutrition industry. Many individuals struggle to find suitable workout routines and meal plans that align with their specific goals and limitations. "GYMPAL" addresses this issue by offering custom meal plans and targeted workouts, ensuring users receive the right resources to succeed.
- <div>What did you learn?</div>
    Throughout our journey, we gained valuable skills in harnessing API's to gather user-selected information efficiently. Utilizing this data, we mastered the art of fetching and displaying user-friendly workout and meal plans. To bolster our proficiency, we adeptly employed HTML, creating a strong foundation with attributes and IDs that streamlined our JavaScript and CSS development. Additionally, we grasped the significance of effective teamwork, communicating progress and addressing errors promptly. This experience allowed us to adeptly navigate unforeseen challenges, ensuring seamless project execution.
